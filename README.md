The Official website of Network for the Open Web - A Mozilla Campus Club

N.O.W. was founded in 2018 with one purpose; well *technically*, three interwoven principles:

- Learn
- Build
- Protect

To that extent, the club has Executives that are responsible with each of these roles, along with a Club Captain. We also have members belonging to cells suited to their skills.
We have conducted a few events, and have laid the groundwork for some more in the coming year.

We're into everything Open Source and all things Secure.

Check out the [website](http://nowmozilla.club) and stay tuned for more updates!
