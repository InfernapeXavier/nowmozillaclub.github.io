# Network for the Open Web

### Welcome to a refreshed _2020_ version of the website!

**NOW** was created to help build and protect the open web, so we thought, why not start from our own website. 
We had one goal in mind.. _Well, more like a few but you get it!_
- No more statically desgined components
- No more ugly white spaces where they don't need to be
- Using a different device? Our website will look as awesome as it did on the other one _Magic_


Built using the power of the internet and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) along with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), NOW invites you to experience a whole new world of Visual _pleasure_!
